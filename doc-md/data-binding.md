## Data Binding
Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the application UI and business logic. If the binding has the correct settings and the data provides 
the proper notifications, then, when the data changes its value, the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes automatically. Data binding can also mean that 
if an outer representation of the data in an element changes, then the underlying data can be automatically updated to reflect the change. For example, if the user edits 
the value in a TextBox element, the underlying data value is automatically updated to reflect that change.

Resources are typically definitions of some object that you expect to use more than once. To refer to a XAML resource later, you specify a key for a resource that acts like its name. You can reference a resource throughout an app or from any XAML page within it.

Resources can be defined: 
* locally for a control
* locally for the entire page/window
* globally for the entire application

**See:** [ResourceDictionary and XAML resource references](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/resourcedictionary-and-xaml-resource-references)

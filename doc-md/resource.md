A resource is an object that can be reused in different places in your application. WPF supports different types of resources (from actual information to a hierarchy of WPF controls). These resources are primarily two types: 
* XAML resources (i.e. brushes and styles)
* resource data files (non-executable data files that an application needs, i.e .json, .csv)

You can define resources: 
* locally for a control
* locally for the entire page/window
* globally for the entire application

## Static and Dynamic Resources
A resource can be referenced as either a static resource or a dynamic resource. See:
* [StaticResource Markup Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/staticresource-markup-extension)
* [DynamicResource Markup Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/dynamicresource-markup-extension)

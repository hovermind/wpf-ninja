## Theme
A typical WPF application might have multiple UI resources that are applied throughout the application. Collectively, this set of resources
can be considered the theme for the application. WPF provides support for packaging UI resources as a theme by using a resource dictionary that is encapsulated as the `ResourceDictionary` class.

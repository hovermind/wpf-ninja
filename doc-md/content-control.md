## Content Control
WPF content controls are a specialized form of WPF controls and are used to store content either entered by the user or read from any other data source. 
Content controls can contain only one child element. This is unlike layout controls such as Grid, WrapPanel and StackPanel controls that contain multiple child elements.

Typical content controls include ToolTip control, Label control all types of Button control, ScrollViewer control and custom UserControl. 
Another set of content control classes derive from HeaderedContentControl class which derives from the abstract ContentControl class. 
These controls contain a header region and content region. Typical examples of these controls are TabItem, GroupBox and Expander controls.

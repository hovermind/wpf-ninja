## UserControl
A `UserControl` is a reusable user-created control that you can add to your UI the same way you would add any other control.

When to use `UserControl`:
* there is a large amount of related XAML code i.e. a **View when using the MVVM design pattern**
* to create some reusable component (but not standalone one) to use it in multiple different Windows
* to build in some custom functionality (for example, a `CalendarControl`)

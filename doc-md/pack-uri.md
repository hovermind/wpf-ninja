## The Pack URI Scheme
Uniform resource identifiers (URIs) are used to identify and load files in many ways:
* Specifying the user interface (UI) to show when an application first starts
* Loading images
* Navigating to pages
* Loading non-executable data files

Furthermore, URIs can be used to identify and load files from a variety of locations:
* The current assembly
* A referenced assembly
* A location relative to an assembly
* The application's site of origin
